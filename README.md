# InfoTrafic Parser
This is a simple tool to extract Traffic Accidents information from [Romanian Police](http://politiaromana.ro/) website. It is a **work-in-progress**, after-work project, so we warmly welcome anyone who wants to contribute.

## The #why and the #how
Romania has one of the highest rates of road traffic deaths in the EU, with 95 dead for every million people. Usually one can get that info from annual reports issued in the following year by Institutes of Statistics from Romania and EU, but we wanted a faster, more *realtime*-ish way to get our hands on that. 

So we'll go to the Romanian Police website and try to crawl for the necessary information. Here we have two pages with very useful information:

 - [InfoTraffic](http://politiaromana.ro/ro/info-trafic) section, containing daily traffic events
 - [Fatal accidents](http://politiaromana.ro/ro/info-trafic/situatia-accidentelor-rutiere-grave-inregistrate-in-ultimele-24-de-ore-la-nivel-national), an almost daily journal of fatal road traffic accidents

We'll work on getting that info in a clear, structured format.
